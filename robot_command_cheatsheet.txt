Instructions for running the data collection process

A. Make sure everything is plugged in:
    i. Kinect to laptop
    ii. Kintect to power source
    iii. Robot/keyboard to laptop
    iv. Laptop to power source
    v. Are all power sources on?

B.  Open four terminals: #=comment

  1. #Enable permissions for robot for rosaria
     sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0

     #then connect to robot
     rosrun rosaria RosAria


  2. #start process to connect keyboard to robot
     rosrun robot_control keyboard_controller

  3.  #connect Kinect to laptop
      roslaunch kinect2_bridge no_point_cloud_kinect2_brigde.launch

  4. #connect keyboard to Kinect
     rosrun save_data save_data

Robot Command Cheat Sheet

All commands are case sensitve.
You MUST PRESS ENTER after each command to input it. Just typing the letter has no effect.

Definitions:
'collect a cluster': rotate 30 degrees 12 times and save an image after each rotation. This is the basic operation of data collection.


Most common commands:

'w' - increase FORWARD velocity
'a' - increase COUNTER-CLOCKWISE rotation velocity
's' - increase CLOCKWISE velocity
'd' - increase BACKWARD velocity
'c' - STOP all motion(velocities set to 0)

Compound Commands. Must enter letter, ENTER, number, ENTER 

'k'
'#'  - Collect a cluster at the current location, then move forward 30cm and collect another cluster, # amount of times. i.e. k, 0 just collects one cluster at the current location. k,1 collects 2 clusters, 1 at the current location and one 30cm forward.


'l'
'#' - Move 30cm, then collect a cluster, then repeat # number of times. So l,0 moves forward once and collects 1 cluster. l,1 collects 2 clusters, moving a total of 60cm, and so on. 

**See the code for all other commands.
